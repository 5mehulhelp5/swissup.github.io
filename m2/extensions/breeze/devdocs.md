# Developers documentation

In these tutorials we'll show you how to make your Magento module or theme
Breeze friendly. Since the Breeze replaces javascript code with its own version,
you will need to write separate Breeze-compatible version of your javascript code.

 -  [Breeze js stack](js-stack/)
 -  [Prepare theme js](theme-js/)
 -  [Prepare module js](module-js/)

Additionally you may look at existing modules with Breeze integration:
