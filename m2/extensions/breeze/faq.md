### Will it work with my theme?

Yes. Hovewer, all custom scripts will not work out of the box. You'll need to
[prepare all your theme js](/m2/extensions/breeze/devdocs/theme-js/)
to work with Breeze.

### Will it work with custom module?

If your module uses custom scripts, it will not work. You'll need to
[integrate your module](/m2/extensions/breeze/devdocs/module-js/)
with Breeze.

### Is it possible to checkout when Breeze is enabled?

Yes. Cart and Checkout pages will use default js functionality.
