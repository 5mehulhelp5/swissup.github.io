### General

`Enabled` - select **Yes** to enable a module.

`Product Page structured data format` - provides you control over format for structured data at product page. By default it is JSON-LD. But you can switch it back to Magento implementation of microdata or turn off structured data at product page at all.

We minify JSON-LD data to reduce page size. You can turn it off with `Minify structured data` option. This can be helpful if you need to debug something.
