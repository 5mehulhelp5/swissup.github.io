# Rich Snippets

This extension helps customers to see the additional information about your store directly on Google search page. Our module offers Google crawlers following rich data which they can add to search results:
 
 -  Product data from your store (SKU, price, currency, availability)
 -  [Information about your organization](configuration/#organization)
 -  [Social media links](configuration/#social-links)
 -  [Website](configuration/#website)

It also enables the **breadcrumbs** trail display in rich snippets. This simplifies a navigation to the product or anything else you promote.

To test structured data at any page of your store you can use [Google Rich Snippets testing tool](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/).
