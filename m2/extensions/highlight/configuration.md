# Configuration

Configuration is located at _Stores > Configuration > Swissup > Highlight_ page.

You can setup general and [highlight pages](/m2/extensions/highlight/pages/) settings here.

## General

![Highlight general config](/images/m2/highlight/configuration/general.png){:width="847.5"}

**Pagination type** - this config allows replacing default pagination toolbar with improved
Highlight toolbar in All Highlight Widgets and Pages. Highlight toolbar doesn't
display count of all products, and doesn't retrieve the last page number. These
two queries are the most consuming DB queries for magento product widgets.
