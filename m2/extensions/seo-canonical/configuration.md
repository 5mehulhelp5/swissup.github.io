You can configure SEO enhancements for paginated content at
_Stores → Configuration → Swissup SEO Suite → Canonical URLs_ page.

### Categories

![Category setting](/images/m2/seo-canonicals/categories.png)

Add canonical URL for category pages with respective option. Please remember enabled [**Pagination module**](/m2/extensions/seo-pager/) **can overpower** this setting.

### Products

![Products setting](/images/m2/seo-canonicals/products.png)

You can enable or disable canonical URL on product page.

Other fun option is *"Use parent product for canonical"*. For product that is a part of configurable, bundle or grouped product, this option forces it to use parent product url as canonical. This feature consolidates Google indexes and can be usefull for stores with huge number of products.

*"Allowed parent types"* - here you can select when feature 'Use parent product for canonical' should work. For example, you can select only bundle and grouped products.

### CMS Pages

![CMS Pages setting](/images/m2/seo-canonicals/cms-pages.png)

Here you can see one and pretty obvious config option.
