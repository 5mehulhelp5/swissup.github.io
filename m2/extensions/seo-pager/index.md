# SEO Pagination

![Rel="next" and rel="prev"](/images/m2/seo-pager/example.png)

Current extension improves presentation of paginated content for search engines. It follows latest recommendations from Google webmaster guide - [Indicate paginated content](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/1663744).

This extension adds **'view-all' link** for paginated content also. Search engines appreciate it as well as regular visitors. Because they can find all products at one page.

We implemented multiple strategies for paginated content. So you can choose one that suites best for your store. Our favorite strartegy for paginated content is enabled 'view-all' link + rel="next" and rel="prev". That is why we use it by default. But you always can change it in [configuration](configuration/).

Other great feature is **page number in title**. It helps to avoid possible duplicate content issues.

Extension works perfectly with:

 -  Category view pages - product listing;
 -  Search results page;
 -  Highlight pages ([Swissup Highlight](https://swissuplabs.com/custom-product-list-extension-for-magento-2.html) extension);
 -  Attribute pages ([Swissup Attribute Pages](https://swissuplabs.com/attributes-and-brands-pages-for-magento-2.html) extension).

> SEO Pagination is a part of [SEO Suite](../seo-suite/) toolkit. And we do not provide it as independent Magento 2 extension.
