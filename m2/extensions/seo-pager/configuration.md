You can configure SEO enhancements for paginated content at
_Stores → Configuration → Swissup SEO Suite → Pagintaion_ page.

![Settings](/images/m2/seo-pager/config.png)

### General

With option "_Enable SEO enhancements_" you can fully disable all the enhancements.

With "_Show view-all link_" you can show or hide view all link at listing toolbar. This link appears at bottom toolbar near page numbers.

![View all link example](/images/m2/seo-pager/view-all-link.png)

"_Strategy of paginated content presentation for search engines_" has three options:

 -  **Leave as-is**. Relay on search engine and its logic only.
 -  **Use rel="canonical" to view all page**. Tell search engine that the View All page is the version you want to appear in search results. So it will crawle this page.
 -  **Use rel="next" and rel="prev"** links to indicate the relationship between component URLs. This markup provides a strong hint to search engine that you would like us to treat these pages as a logical sequence, thus consolidating their linking properties and usually sending searchers to the first page.
