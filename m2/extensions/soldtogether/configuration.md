### Frequently Bought Together

You can enable 'Frequently Bought Together' block at product page with this section. Also you can select its layout:
    
 -  Default - similiar to what Amazon site has;
 -  Stripes - used in [Argento Stripes](/m2/argento/stripes/page-structure/product-page/#soldtogether-blocks) theme.

Option "Count Products to Display" is pretty self-explanatory. It sets number of products to display (products with largest weight of relations).

Option "List random products for empty collections" can be really helpful for stores that just started. Or for new products that has no relations with existing ones.

And with "Show Out Of Stock Products" you can select to show out of stock products in block.
