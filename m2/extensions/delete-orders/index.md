# Delete Orders

Magento 2 default does not support to remove sale records from admin page. Therefore admins cannot delete either tests recods or called off records.
That only will increase the number of junk orders and will confuse.
Our module Helps the order management much more organized by clearing the junk ones.
You can choose to delete one `order` or several `orders` at the same time. Once orders are deleted, their linked data will also be immediately removed from your store.
 Also you may remove other records such as `Invoices`, `Shipments` and `Credit Memos`, separate from one another or separate from its order.

> This `Free extension for Magento 2`, helps you safely remove unnecessary `Orders`, `Invoices`, `Shipments` and `Credit Memos` or records which have
been arisen during testing your store, that is to put in order your sales.
After installing it, additional action appears at:
- `Sales->Orders->Actions->Delete` - remove order(s),
- `Sales->Invoices->Actions->Delete` - remove invoice(s),
- `Sales->Shipments->Actions->Delete` - remove shipment(s),
- `Sales->Credit Memos->Actions->Delete` - remove creditmemo(s).
