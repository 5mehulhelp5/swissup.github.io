# Delete Orders

Magento 2 default does not support remove orders from admin page.Therefore admins cannot delete either tests orders or called off orders.
That only will increase the number of junk orders and will confuse.
Our module Helps the order management much more organized by clearing the junk ones.
You can choose to delete one order or several orders at the same time. Once orders are deleted, their linked data will also be immediately removed from your store.

>*This `Free extension for Magento 2`, helps you safely remove unnecessary orders or orders which have
been arisen during testing your store, that is to put in order your sales. After installing this additional action appears at `Sales->Orders->Actions->Swissup_Delete`*
