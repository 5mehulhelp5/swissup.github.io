There are several ways to install extension:

 1. If you've bought the product at Magento's Marketplace - use
    [Marketplace installation instructions](marketplace/)
 2. Otherwise, you have two options:
    - Install the sources directly from [our repository](composer/) - **recommended**
    - Download archive and use [manual installation](manual/)
