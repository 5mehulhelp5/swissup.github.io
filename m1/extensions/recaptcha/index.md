# ReCAPTCHA from Google

![reCAPTCHA exapmles](/images/m1/extensions/recaptcha/cover.png)

 1. [Installation](installation/)
 2. [Changelog](changelog/)
 3. [Extension Configuration](extension-configuration/)

Protect your website from spam and abuse while letting real people pass through check with ease. Your customers can now attest they are human without having to solve a CAPTCHA. They will be allowed to confirm they are not a robot via single click only.

Our Magento extension provides your store frontend and backendre with CAPTCHA from Google. It replaces default Magento CAPTCHA with more secure Google reCAPTCHA.

**Notice:** current version of this extension does not provide security CAPTCHAs to any other form than your Magento instance. It just replaces default Magento CAPTCHA. So if your store has a disabled CAPTCHA, then you have to enable it first. Please, read Magento User Guide how to do that - [Security CAPTCHA](http://docs.magento.com/m1/ce/user_guide/store-operations/security-captcha.html).
