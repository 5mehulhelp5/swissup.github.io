# Managing ticket

Tickets interface allows to manage tickets and answer them from admin interface. Admin users can create tickets from the backend and reply to the tickets via email.
Tickets can be created from orders page, customers information page or directly from tickets listing interface. Customers can create tickets from their account pages, contact or custom Helpmate form. 

In order to create ticket from the backend, go `Admin > Templates Master > Helpmate > Tickets` and click on **Add New ticket**.

So, first you can try find an answer using a list of quick answers based on predefined templates. You can also write a comment and hide it from other users. Attach a file to the ticket if you need. If you still need a help, please fill out the rest of fileds and **Save ticket**.

In the `Notes` field, you can enter any kind of information you want. This field is visible for admin users only and is out of customers reach.
