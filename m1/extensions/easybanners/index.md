Easy Banners allows you to display regular banners and custom content like
an information about scheduled events and holidays related content, display your
payments and security icons, target specific customers groups, place banners
inside of cms pages or directly in templates files, display several banners
or content blocks at the same placeholders, monitor the number of displays and
hits of a banner.

Please review the basic terms before using the extension.

**Banner** - is individual block that contains images, html text, javascript
code, video or flash objects. Each banner can be linked to one or more
placeholders. (Except Lightbox and Awesomebar types. They cannot be attached to

to any magento block. The purpose of placeholder - is to show and rotate banners
on each page reload.
