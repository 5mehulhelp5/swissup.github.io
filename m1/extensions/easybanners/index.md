![Easy Banners](/images/m1/extensions/easy-banners/banner-frontend.png)

Easy Banners is based on Magento core functionality. It supports unlimited number of placeholders and banners. Now you can display an information about scheduled events and holidays related on content, display or show banner url, display your payments and security icons, target specific customers groups, place banners inside of cms pages or directly in templates files, display several banners or content blocks at the same placeholders, monitor the number of displays and hits of a banner. 

Please review the basic terms before using the extension.

`Banner` - is individual block that contains images, html text, javascript code or flash objects. Each banner can be linked to one or more placeholders.

`Placeholder` - is custom container for banners, that can be linked to any main reference magento block. It's possible to list them, add or delete placeholders at "Manage Placeholders" admin interface through standard Magento grid.
