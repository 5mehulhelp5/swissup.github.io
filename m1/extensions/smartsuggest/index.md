# Smart Suggest

Adding recommended products block around the website is always optimal solution to increase an order summary. Our module allows you to place the suggested products both on product page (link) and category page (link). Smart Suggest extension comes with widget (link) that allows you to save a time while adding a related products block.
 
How it works? The module is analyzing the products from the same category or an attribute list, the user was browsing before. In order to set the priority of products to be displayed in block, you can use different rules (link). Our extension enables the search of suggested products based on your own recommendation (link). Moreover you are allowed to filter suggested items by price range (link) of previously browsed products.
