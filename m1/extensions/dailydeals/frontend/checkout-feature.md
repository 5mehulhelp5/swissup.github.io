# Checkout feature

There are two critical situations that can happen while placing the order by
customer:

- deal ends before buyer clicked **`Place order`** on checkout;
- store owner changes the amount of deal before buyer clicks **`Place order`** on
checkout.

In such cases can occur bad situation, when buyer saw one amount in order
summary on checkout and the amount looks different in final order.

Our extension will help you to avoid unpleasant experience with your
customers. We offer to redirect the customer to shopping cart with a message about
any mismatches during placing orders with daily deals.

This verification supports standard Magento Onepage and Multishipping Checkout
and FireCheckout from Templates Master. If you have other checkout extension it would also be provided with verification feature. Please contact our support team.
