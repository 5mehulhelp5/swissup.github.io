# Daily Deals

By definition, daily deal is an ecommerce business model in which a website
offers a single product for sale for a period of 24 to 36 hours.

Our extension allows you create deals that last one, two, three or more days.
You can even make deal that lasts few weeks and include more than one product.
Also with our extension you can create periodic deals. For example, periodic
weekend deal or periodic friday night deal.
