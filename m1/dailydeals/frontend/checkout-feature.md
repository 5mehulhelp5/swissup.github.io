# Checkout feature

There are two critical situations that can happen while customer placing order:

- deal ends right before buyer clicked **`Place order`** on checkout;
- store owner change deal or canceled before buyer clicked **`Place order`** on
checkout.

In such cases can occur bad situation, when buyer saw one amount in order
summary on checkout and this amount is different in final order.

That is why our extension has additional check to prevent buyers from unpleasant
experience with your store. We redirect customer to shopping cart with a message
if there are any mismatches during placing orders for products with deal.

This verification supports standard Magento Onepage and Multishipping Checkout
and FireCheckout from Templates Master. If you have other checkout it also can
be integrated in verification, just contact with our support team.
