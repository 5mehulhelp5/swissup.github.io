# Features right from the box

Look at what you get on frontend after you create deal. Screenshots are taken from
RWD theme:

* **Product view page for product that is in deal look**

![Product view example](/images/dailydeals/frontend/product-view.png)

* **Page with all products listing in active deals at this moment** (if you
created deal but there are still no products on page ***'Deals today'***, please
check the root category - it should have option `Is anchored` set to `Yes`)

* If customer **adds to a cart the product from deal** and deal ends less than
in a 10 minutes, then he will see the message next to the product:
