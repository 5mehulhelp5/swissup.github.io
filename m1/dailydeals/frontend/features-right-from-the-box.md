After you create deal here is what you get on frontend (screenshots taken on RWD
theme):

* **Product view page for product that is in deal look**

* **Page with list of all products in active deals at this moment** (if you
created deal but there are no products on page ***'Deals today'***, then check
root category - it should have option `Is anchored` set to `Yes`)
